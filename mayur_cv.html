			<td><strong>Project Summary</strong><br>
		<p>The objective of this paper is to present a Patient Monitoring System using LabVIEW, which enables continous monitoring of a patient and helps the doctors to make better diagnosis. The system acquires, analyses and processes certain physiological parameters of a patient such as body temperature, Electrocardiofram and pulse rate. NI LabVIEW is used to take readings from the sensors such as body temperature, ECG sensor and pulse sensor which are connected to myRio (Reconfigurable I/O).
